# Amazon product reviews: topic modeling
_A topic modeling (unsupervised learning) mini-project_

This project aims to model and visualize topics in a corpus of over 300,000 product reviews from Amazon. Specifically, the reviews come from the foods department between 2002 and 2012, and duplicate reviews have been removed. You can [view the original dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews).

The key packages used in this project are scikit-learn and Yellowbrick, along with the usual pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
